# Part 1: Bori’s buddy

Talk about Boris’ buddy, struggling to fill a prescription for days; an all-too-common situation especially for drugs in high-demand.

Buddy hops and calls around and gets the same answer: we’re out, call in a couple of days. But the pain is now.

# Part 2: Enter PillPatrol

Our AI-agent makes calls to pharmacies about the drugs we know patients need. We then update our database with the latest information on inventory.

- I’d be nice to see some kind of animation of the agent hitting up different points n a map (pharmacies) and learning about supply.

# Part 3: How it works

PillPatrol actively patrols pharmacies to keep our live inventory knowledge up to date.

When a doctor (or their office) needs to prescribe a medication to a patient, they use PillPatrol to send the patient to the best pharmacy with the highest confidence that it’ll be filled!

# Wrapping up

Pill Patrol saves patients - and doctor’s offices - time and energy. Without exaggeration, sometimes we save patients from continued pain.
